Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a structured approach to developing software systems, it emphasizes systematic principles, methods and best practices to develop high quality, reliable, and maintainable software systems or software products.
Traditional programming refers to the act of writing code without necessarily following systematic or formalized methods, principles or processes.
They differ in the sense that traditional programming just focuses on coding tasks, while software engineering takes a broader view to consider the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) emphasizing beyond just coding tasks or writing code and focussing also on requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
This cycle consists of a 6 step approach of sequential process of forming a software.
Requirements
Requirements can be regarded as all needed items to ensure an end product. This ranges from documents  used to design, people designated to carrying the design and equipment. A software requirement is a property which must be exhibited in order to solve some problem.
Design 
Software design is the software engineering life cycle activity in which software requirements are analyzed in order to produce a description of the softwareâ€™s internal structure that will serve as the basis for its construction. More precisely, a software design must describe the software architecture, that is, how software is decomposed and organized into components and the interfaces between those components. It must also describe the components at a level of detail that enables their construction.
Implementation 
This stage brings the plan into life,where the plan is executed. Encoding and development takes place. Where we combine small subunits to a big unit
Testing.
Includes executing a number of tests that monitor the readiness of the end product/software. The system ,the user acceptance and how all units can integrate in one achord.
Testing is an activity performed for evaluating product quality, and for improving it, by identifying defects and problems. Software testing consists of the dynamic verification of the behavior of a program on a finite set of test cases, suitably selected from the usually infinite executions domain, against the expected behavior. 
Deployment
This stage is reached once testing has been successful in preparation to release the software
Maintenance
Software Maintenance, is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment.4


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall Model : 
Uses a sequential predictive approach in managing a project. Where a new distinct phase cannot be completed without the previous step.
Scenario is a client accessing a bank app.One cannot process to the next step without completing a prior stage
EG: Paying a business or sending money back home.
Open the banking app.Proceed to sign in (could be via biometrics or a pin). Click on the icon you intend (pay) to perform the action. Select beneficiary if not there proceed to register one. Be specific on the amount and confirm the payment.
The confirmation of a payment can not go through with the above mentioned steps.
Agile Model:
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It breaks the development process into small iterations called "sprints," typically lasting 1-4 weeks, where cross-functional teams work on small increments of functionality


Agile focuses on delivering working software quickly and frequently, allowing for early and continuous delivery of value to customers. It values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan while Waterfall emphasizes thorough planning and documentation upfront, with little room for changes once the project is underway. It's suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and stable technology.


Waterfall
Agile
Does not allow changes to be made once a phase has been completed.


Allows change to be done at any given time..
Optimal for small scaled project development.
It is really useful in large and complex projects
Optimal for large complex projects
Allows testing of the software to be done when the complete product has been completed
Allows testing of the software at any given point without completing the entire product.


More structured and rigid in development.
Allows flexibility 



Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is defined as a strict yet systematic approach to the creation,definition and verification of the requirements for a software system. The process itself consists of a number of tasks that aid in bringing an understanding,recording and managing the demands of the stakeholders.The process includes a 
Feasibility study: Looks over the feasibility of the project by checking the technical,economic ,legal and operational aspects of the software system.
Requirements elicitation: The process of compiling all needed information about what is expected and needed by the stakeholders. This can be done by conduction research in the form of focus groups,observations or interviews.
Requirements Specification: The production of having a formal software requirement specification document. The document aims to gather the needed requirements using diagrams or formal language.
Requirements for verification and validation: This stage aims to review the requirements needed for accuracy as well as to enforce and review that the needs of the stakeholders will be well met.
Requirements management the process ensures to analyze,document and tracking to prioritize and agree with the relevant stakeholders: 
The process plays a key role in the SDLC  as in ensuring the translation of the incomplete  needs and wishes of the users to precise,formal and complete specifications of the software.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is the act/practice of deconstructing a large software system into smaller  yet independent components that are responsible  and consist of a well defined interface. Each module is set to handle a specific function thus functions independently
Modules can be updated, modified, or replaced without affecting the entire system and with regards to scalability it allows a developer to add new modules brimming more efficiency into the system.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing is regarded as accessing the software system systematically to ensure that the system meets its function and quality of the set standard.
Unit Testing: Individual units of the the software this ensures that each unit does work correctly without fault
Integration Testing: Focuses on the interactions between units and components,this test aims on components working together efficiently.
System Testing:Tests the entire software systems, aims to detect that the system functions optimally  with performance.
Acceptance Testing: Test the entire software system that it can meet requirements to meet the user needs
Testing is important as it ensures that the software is reliable,performs optimally and is of good quality


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems is a category of tools that aims to aid in noting any changes made to the files. It keeps track of any rectification and modifications done in the code.
It is thus important as it helps developers to communicate efficiently and in return track all the modifications made to the source code. It also includes all the details of the contributors of what change was done and when it was done
Eg:Concurrent Versions System,record the history of sources files, and documents.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

The key role of a software project manager is to plan,monitor and control
Key responsibilities include the write up of the project proposal narrowing and bringing detail to the project cost estimation. The risk involved, the project staff and report writing.


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the constant change to carry out an upgrade or correct or alter the functioning of a software application that was deployed to a user. The aim is to improve its performance.
Different types of maintenance:
Preventative: Done to prevent any proceeding probable problems that may come forth in the optimal functioning of the software in the future.


Adaptive Maintenance: Refers to all modifications that are done or needed to keep the software up to date with the ever changing tech world.
Perfective Maintenance: This maintenance is mainly carried out to always optimize and be functional for an extended period of time. This brings forth more reliable software.


Corrective Maintenance: Performed to correct any problems which are usually voiced out by users or any error reports.
It is deemed essential to give ongoing support and enhancements to the software.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Software engineers may encounter the following:
Bias Algorithm
 Ethical Issue:
They ought to avoid any algorithm that can lead to inequality and discrimination This can lead to the software system deem untrustworthy
Example:
	Biased algorithms in hiring systems that disadvantages other candidates based on gender, race, or socio-economic background


Privacy violation: 
Ethical issue: 
The need to always ensure that the handling and storing of personal information ensures confidentiality  and any data collected serves the purpose of intention.
	Example:
The scandal of Facebook where users data was harvested without users consent for political use


 Security:
	Ethical issue:
Creating software systems with known security vulnerabilities that 
can be exploited by malicious actors
Example:
	The equifax data breach where hackers exploited a vulnerability to 
Access millions of users' personal information.




Software engineers should familiarize themselves with ethical guidelines and 
codes of conduct established by professional organizations such as the IEEE 
(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
